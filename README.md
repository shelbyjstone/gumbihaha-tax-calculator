The rulers of the SME Kingdom, Stef, Mark and Erich require that the peasants pay taxes so that the kingdom has adequate finances to operate effectively and to keep Stef, Mark and Erich in the luxurious lifestyle that they have become accustomed to.

In order to achieve this, the following income taxes will be levied:

·       All earnings up to but less than $24000 will incur a 33% tax

·       All earnings from $24000 and up to but less than $48000 will incur a 20% tax

·       All earnings from $48000 and up to but less than $80000 will incur a 17.5% tax

·       All earnings from $80000 will incur a 48% tax

The intention of this scheme is to encourage the population to go out and actively engage in paid work and to strive for a good life. This is based on something that Stef, Mark and Erich read in a fortune cookie, which said that a population with a strong middle class results in lower overall costs to the Kingdom as people have enough money to keep themselves healthy and tend to pay for things themselves, thus leaving money within the Kingdom's treasury accounts for Stef, Mark and Erich.

Please build a fully tested tax calculator to effect this policy by next week and be prepared to present your solution for peer review. The best tax solution will be implemented with immediate effect and the authors will be exempt from all taxes within the kingdom forthwith.

·       You may not write any code that is not first covered by tests.

·       You may not write any function with more than 6 lines of code in the body.

·       You may not write any class with more than 4 methods.

·       You must develop the solution with some flexibility in mind, in case Stef, Mark and Erich are influenced by another fortune cookie.

·       You must apply all of your learnings to date and present your working code to the group next week.

All hail the SME Kingdom.
