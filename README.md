# Gumbihaha Income Tax Calculator

The ruler of the Gumbihaha Kingdom, King Gumbi requires that the peasants pay taxes so the kingdom has adequate finances to operate effectively and to keep King Gumbi in the luxurious lifestyle that he is accustomed to.

In order to achieve this, the following income taxes will be levied:

·       All earnings up to but less than $24000 will incur a 33% tax

·       All earnings from $24000 and up to but less than $48000 will incur a 20% tax

·       All earnings from $48000 and up to but less than $80000 will incur a 17.5% tax

·       All earnings above $80000 will incur a 48% tax

The intention of this scheme is to encourage the population to go out and actively engage in paid work and to individually strive for a good life. This policy is based on something that King Gumbi read in a fortune cookie, which said that a population with a strong middle class results in lower overall costs to the Kingdom as people have enough money to keep themselves healthy and tend to pay for things themselves, thus leaving money within the Kingdom's treasury accounts for King Gumbi.

Please build a fully tested tax calculator to effect this policy by next week and be prepared to present your solution for peer review. The best tax solution will be implemented with immediate effect and the authors will be exempt from all taxes within the kingdom forthwith.

·       You may not write any code that is not first covered by tests.

·       You may not write any function with more than 6 lines of code in the body.

·       You may not write any class with more than 4 methods.

·       You must develop the solution with some flexibility in mind, in case King Gumbi is influenced by yet another fortune cookie in the future.

·       You must apply all of your learnings to date and present your working code to the group next week.

All hail the Gumbihaha Kingdom.
